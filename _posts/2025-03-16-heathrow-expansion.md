Few would argue that Britain’s economy is thriving. Growth has stagnated, investor confidence is weak, and households continue to struggle in the aftermath of sticky inflation. Against this backdrop, a third runway at London Heathrow Airport hardly seems like an obvious priority for the UK government. Rachel Reeves disagrees. The Chancellor underlines Heathrow’s importance in air freight and business travel as reasons to back the expansion. An increase in potential GDP of 0.43% by 2050 is the ultimate reward, according to a recent report by Frontier Economics. But this may not appear particularly significant nor relevant to the average Briton. So how can the expansion of the UK’s singular hub airport achieve Reeves’ goal of putting “pounds in people’s pockets”? Air freight and business travel aside, could its successful delivery kickstart a long-overdue revival of British infrastructure investment?

The proposed third Heathrow runway is part of a long list of ambitious British infrastructure projects which have faced ballooning costs, delays, and policy reversals over the past two decades. The cost of HS2, once estimated at £37.5bn, is now forecast at up to £71bn. The UK’s first nuclear power station in over 20 years, Hinkley Point C, is running at least a year behind schedule and £500m over budget. The Stonehenge tunnel, designed to ease congestion around the popular tourist site, has been cancelled entirely due to soaring costs of almost £2bn for just 8 miles of road. These are not isolated cases: Britain’s per-mile costs of railways, trams, and roads far exceed those in Germany, France, and the EU overall. And yet Heathrow’s third runway is viewed as a particularly challenging endeavour. Alongside re-routing an entire section of one of Europe’s busiest motorways, the Mayor of London and environmental groups will argue that a third runway is “incompatible” with the UK’s legally binding net-zero targets.

Despite these obstacles, Reeves appears resolute. Her February speech backing the third runway was bold and confident. She later voiced her desire to have “flights off within a decade” and replied with an emphatic “no” when asked if the Mayor of London could halt the expansion. Meanwhile, she promises parallel reform to outdated planning systems, aiming to bring the costs of infrastructure development in line with European neighbours. After decades of paralysis and uncertainty, the speech was well-received among civil engineering leaders. Canadian engineering giant AtkinsRéalis approved of the actions to “remove barriers” and provide “long-term certainty”, whilst leading infrastructure consulting firm AECOM emphasised the expansion's importance in “securing growth and the UK’s ability to maintain its position on the international stage”. If well-executed, the expansion of Heathrow Airport could signal to stakeholders that Britain is once again a sure bet for investment.

The Chancellor will certainly hope that this private sector sentiment continues. The UK has consistently lagged behind its international peers in investment performance. For 24 of the last 30 years, the country has ranked at the bottom of the G7 investment leaderboard. Dismal productivity growth and economic performance have followed. An investment drive, fuelled by a new-found private sector confidence and certainty, could be an important first step in resolving the UK’s long-running productivity slump. The government will expect this to translate into economic growth and sorely needed tax revenues, which Reeves will rely upon if she is to turn around Britain’s struggling public services.

The challenge for the Chancellor is whether she can stay resolute in the face of political pressure. The government has not committed public funds to Heathrow. Nonetheless, it will almost certainly face tough political opposition, and genuine planning reform is required for the expansion to become credible. Even if progress is made, large-scale infrastructure projects are unlikely to deliver any tangible economic benefits for at least a decade, making them difficult to sustain politically. Successive governments have opted to appease voters with short-term policymaking. However, as the last two decades have taught us, this does not appear to be placing Britain on a sustainable growth path.

Heathrow boss Thomas Woldbye warned that a third runway would take “Churchillian resolve” to deliver. Rachel Reeves may very well need to draw upon the “Bulldog’s” determination if she is to break Britain’s infrastructure paralysis.
